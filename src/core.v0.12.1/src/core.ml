(** [Core] is an extension of {{!Core_kernel}[Core_kernel]} with Unix APIs. The unmodified
    libraries can be found there.

    In particular, [Core] has comprehensive implementation of times ([Time] and
    [Time_ns]), where some details are platform-specific.

    Some modules are mere extensions of those existing in [Core_kernel], like [Bigstring],
    [Caml], [Time], and [Md5], where what's added is handlers for reading from or writing
    to Unix sockets and file descriptors, or support for floating-point numbers. Other
    modules are entirely new, like:

    - [Command], a richly featured tool for creating command-line programs.
    - [Iobuf], which lets you use contiguous ranges of bytes for I/O purposes.
    - [Linux_ext], providing a wrapper around Linux-specific system calls.
    - [Signal], for handling Unix signals like SIGHUP and SIGKILL.

    A few modules in Core don't have any platform-specific functionality but haven't yet
    been ported to Core_kernel for technical reasons (like a dependency on [Time], which
    until recently was only in Core):

    - [Interval]
